On the evening of April 14, the "Californian" was surrounded by ice and was forced to stop until morning.\n     At 11:00 p.m., Captain Lord orders a message to be broadcast on the radio warning ships sailing in the area of dangerous ice blocks. On board \n     the Titanic, the message was ignored and radio operators Phillips and Bride did not report it to the officer on the watch on the bridge (it should be noted, \n     however, that by 1912 the radio was still a technical novelty and had not become an indispensable part of navigation on the ship). \n     After the message is broadcast, the radio operator of the "Californian" turns off the radio station and goes to sleep because his shift is over. \n     A little later that evening, Titanic's two Mars watchers alerted of the presence of an iceberg on the ship's course. At this moment, the distance\n     to it is approximately 200-250 meters, and the air temperature is about -10 Â°C. First Mate William Murdoch, who is on the bridge, gives the standard \n     command in such a situation: "Port on board, engines full astern!". The relatively poor maneuverability of the ship at its speed at that moment - about 24 knots, however,\n     made the collision inevitable - the iceberg split the hull from the bow along the starboard side for a length of about 90 - 100 meters.\n     An interesting fact is that during the investigation of the accident, many analysts are of the opinion that if the ship had met the iceberg\n     with its bow, at most the two bow compartments would have been crushed and it would have remained afloat. The breach water thus obtained begins \n     to fill the forward five watertight compartments of the ship, provided that the Titanic is able to remain buoyant with at most four adjacent bow \n     or stern compartments (or any two with other compartments) flooded. Titanic's chief designer, Thomas Andrews, notified Captain J. Smith that the sinking \n     of the ship was only a matter of time. When the lowering of the lifeboats has already begun, the captain is still relatively calm - the lights of a ship can\n      be seen near them. No one doubts that this is the "Californian". But this ship did not respond to the radio signals or the distress flares sent by the Titanic.\n       At one point his lights go out and he disappears into the night like a mirage. Sinking in only about 2 hours and 40 minutes, the Titanic caused the deaths \n       of more than 1,500 victims. Only 704 people were saved, who in the early hours of the next day were put on the ship "Karpatia".   \n    </p>\n   </article>\n   </div>`,i=` <div class="artHistory">\n   <img class="scheme" src=${e.p+"images/structure.jpg"} alt="titanic" />\n   <h3>Dimensions and schematics of the ship</h3>\n   <p> - tonnage: 46,328 gross register tons & displacement:52,310 tons;</p>\n   <p> - length: 269 m. & width:28.2 m;</p>\n   <p> - height:53.3 m (from the keel to the top of the chimneys);</p>\n   </div>`,a={"/":t,"/intro":`<div class="history">\n<img class="introPhoto" src=${e.p+"images/distance_banner.jpg"} alt="titanic" />\n<article class="artHistory">\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\nBuilt at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, with a displacement of approximately 66,000 tons, the Titanic was the largest passenger \nsteamship in the world at the time. Its design speed reaches 24 knots (approximately 45 km/h) and is close to that of the record-breaking \nMauretania and Lusitania of the rival company Cunard Line. The abbreviation RMS in its name stands for Royal Mail Ship ("Royal Mail Ship") \nand was placed before the names of ships authorized to carry postal items under contract with the British state postal service Royal Mail.\nOn its maiden transatlantic voyage from Southampton (England), with brief stops at Cherbourg (France) and Cove (Ireland) (known until 1920 as Queenstown), \nto New York, it struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on the evening of April 14, 1912 (Sunday) and sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. \non April 15, 1912 (Monday), after splitting in two.\n</article>`,"/history":n,"/schematics":i,"/investigation":`<div class="history">\n<img class="introPhoto" src=${e.p+"images/oceangate-illustration-andrea-gatti.jpg"} alt="titanic" />\n<article class="invest">\nFor decades, the iceberg was believed to have cut through the Titanic's skin like a knife. It is assumed that the borehole\n was about 90 meters long and about 2 meters wide. But this breach was probably seen by only two people - Captain Edward John Smith \n and Engineer Thomas Andrews. Both perish with the ship.\n In the summer of 1986, Prof. Robert Ballard of the Woodshall Oceanographic Institute with a team of two people reached the wreck of the \n Titanic at a depth of 3795 m. For this purpose, they use the mini-submarine "Alvin" and the photo robot "Jason Junior" attached to "Alvin".\n They look at everything that interests them, take lots of pictures and videos. Although they carefully inspect the starboard side of the ship,\n they find no typical penetrations, only dents in the plating and cracks in the rivet locations. The conclusion is that the side of the ship was\n not cut, but split along the rivet seams from the pressure of contact with the iceberg.\n At the end of 2005, a group of researchers, after numerous in-depth studies and experiments, came to the conclusion that if the best rivets \n (according to the then British standard) were used in the construction of the Titanic - from steel with a carbon content of 0.4% instead\n the best rivets actually used were 0.3% carbon steel, the Titanic would probably have remained buoyant. A higher carbon rivet would withstand \n pressures in excess of 1000kN, but savings were made at the expense of steel strength. Thus, it could not withstand more than 350 kN.\n</article>`,"/legends":`<div class="history">\n<img class="legendsPhoto" src=${e.p+"images/legends.jpg"} alt="titanic" />\n<article class="invest">\nThe sea wolves tell about the ominous consequences of the disaster. For years, there have been rumors that ships continue to receive \nradio signals from the sunken Titanic. One such case was recorded on April 15, 1972, when a radio operator of the American warship \n"Theodore Roosevelt" received a distress signal from a long-sunk ocean liner.\nAt first, the person thought he was hallucinating or that someone had decided to play a bad joke. He immediately made contact with the \nshore, but on the other side he received a surprising reply: "Do not respond to the SOS signal, continue on the same course".\nWhen he went ashore, the radio operator was immediately surrounded by FBI agents, who demanded an explanation for his actions,\n and then subjected him to a psychological test.

These microorganisms, adapted to the extreme conditions of\n the deep ocean, play a crucial role in the ship's natural decay process.

By studying these \nmicroorganisms, researchers gain insights into the natural processes that shape the deep-sea environment and contribute to the ongoing narrative of the Titanic's fate.\n\nThe extremophiles not only highlight the resilience of life in extreme environments but also serve as a reminder of the interconnectedness\n of biological and geological processes on the ocean floor.
