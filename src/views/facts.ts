<h6>The First Lifeboat Launched Was Almost Empty:</h6>
<p>
On the night of the sinking, the first lifeboat to be launched, Lifeboat 7, had a capacity of 65 people,
 but it left the ship with only 28 aboard. The crew was reluctant to return to the wreckage to rescue others 
 due to concerns about being pulled under by desperate passengers.

<h6>The Myth of the Unsinkable Ship:</h6>
<p>
While the Titanic was touted as "unsinkable," it was actually advertised as being able to stay afloat with any three 
of its compartments flooded. The iceberg damage caused the flooding of five compartments, ultimately leading to the ship's tragic sinking.
</p>
<h6>A Fictional Novel Predicted the Disaster:</h6>
<p>
Fourteen years before the Titanic sank, a novella titled "Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan" was published. 
The book tells the story of a fictional ocean liner, the Titan, which sank in the North Atlantic after hitting an iceberg.
 The similarities between the fictional and real events are eerie.
