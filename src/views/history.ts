    <p>The agony of the most luxurious passenger ship of its time, announced in advance as "unsinkable", lasts two hours and forty minutes.
    About 1,500 passengers and crew perished in a few hours. The exact number of Bulgarians has not been established - according to data 
    from Lloyd's of London, 38 died. It is assumed that about 15 Bulgarians survived, with most staying forever in America.

    <p>On the night of Titanic's fatal encounter with a Greenland iceberg, the 6,000-ton ship Californian with Captain Stanley Lord was traveling
     in the same direction (to Boston). On the evening of April 14, the "Californian" was surrounded by ice and was forced to stop until morning.
     At 11:00 p.m., Captain Lord orders a message to be broadcast on the radio warning ships sailing in the area of dangerous ice blocks. On board 
     the Titanic, the message was ignored and radio operators Phillips and Bride did not report it to the officer on the watch on the bridge (it should be noted, 
     however, that by 1912 the radio was still a technical novelty and had not become an indispensable part of navigation on the ship). 
     After the message is broadcast, the radio operator of the "Californian" turns off the radio station and goes to sleep because his shift is over. 
     A little later that evening, Titanic's two Mars watchers alerted of the presence of an iceberg on the ship's course. At this moment, the distance
     to it is approximately 200-250 meters, and the air temperature is about -10 Â°C. First Mate William Murdoch, who is on the bridge, gives the standard 
     command in such a situation: "Port on board, engines full astern!". The relatively poor maneuverability of the ship at its speed at that moment - about 24 knots, however,
     made the collision inevitable - the iceberg split the hull from the bow along the starboard side for a length of about 90 - 100 meters.
     An interesting fact is that during the investigation of the accident, many analysts are of the opinion that if the ship had met the iceberg
     with its bow, at most the two bow compartments would have been crushed and it would have remained afloat. The breach water thus obtained begins 
     to fill the forward five watertight compartments of the ship, provided that the Titanic is able to remain buoyant with at most four adjacent bow 
     or stern compartments (or any two with other compartments) flooded. Titanic's chief designer, Thomas Andrews, notified Captain J. Smith that the sinking 
     of the ship was only a matter of time. When the lowering of the lifeboats has already begun, the captain is still relatively calm - the lights of a ship can
      be seen near them. No one doubts that this is the "Californian". But this ship did not respond to the radio signals or the distress flares sent by the Titanic.
       At one point his lights go out and he disappears into the night like a mirage. Sinking in only about 2 hours and 40 minutes, the Titanic caused the deaths 
       of more than 1,500 victims. Only 704 people were saved, who in the early hours of the next day were put on the ship "Karpatia".
