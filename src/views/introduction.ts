<h3>Introduction</h3>
Built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, with a displacement of approximately 66,000 tons, the Titanic was the largest passenger 
steamship in the world at the time. Its design speed reaches 24 knots (approximately 45 km/h) and is close to that of the record-breaking 
Mauretania and Lusitania of the rival company Cunard Line. The abbreviation RMS in its name stands for Royal Mail Ship ("Royal Mail Ship") 
and was placed before the names of ships authorized to carry postal items under contract with the British state postal service Royal Mail.
On its maiden transatlantic voyage from Southampton (England), with brief stops at Cherbourg (France) and Cove (Ireland) (known until 1920 as Queenstown), 
to New York, it struck an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on the evening of April 14, 1912 (Sunday) and sank two hours and forty minutes later at 2:20 a.m. 
on April 15, 1912 (Monday), after splitting in two.
