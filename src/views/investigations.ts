For decades, the iceberg was believed to have cut through the Titanic's skin like a knife. It is assumed that the borehole
 was about 90 meters long and about 2 meters wide. But this breach was probably seen by only two people - Captain Edward John Smith 
 and Engineer Thomas Andrews. Both perish with the ship.
 In the summer of 1986, Prof. Robert Ballard of the Woodshall Oceanographic Institute with a team of two people reached the wreck of the 
 Titanic at a depth of 3795 m. For this purpose, they use the mini-submarine "Alvin" and the photo robot "Jason Junior" attached to "Alvin".
 They look at everything that interests them, take lots of pictures and videos. Although they carefully inspect the starboard side of the ship,
 they find no typical penetrations, only dents in the plating and cracks in the rivet locations. The conclusion is that the side of the ship was
 not cut, but split along the rivet seams from the pressure of contact with the iceberg.
 At the end of 2005, a group of researchers, after numerous in-depth studies and experiments, came to the conclusion that if the best rivets 
 (according to the then British standard) were used in the construction of the Titanic - from steel with a carbon content of 0.4% instead
 the best rivets actually used were 0.3% carbon steel, the Titanic would probably have remained buoyant. A higher carbon rivet would withstand 
 pressures in excess of 1000kN, but savings were made at the expense of steel strength. Thus, it could not withstand more than 350 kN.
