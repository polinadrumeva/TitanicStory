The sea wolves tell about the ominous consequences of the disaster. For years, there have been rumors that ships continue to receive 
radio signals from the sunken Titanic. One such case was recorded on April 15, 1972, when a radio operator of the American warship 
"Theodore Roosevelt" received a distress signal from a long-sunk ocean liner.
At first, the person thought he was hallucinating or that someone had decided to play a bad joke. He immediately made contact with the 
shore, but on the other side he received a surprising reply: "Do not respond to the SOS signal, continue on the same course".
When he went ashore, the radio operator was immediately surrounded by FBI agents, who demanded an explanation for his actions,
 and then subjected him to a psychological test. The case was forgotten, but later it turned out that similar cases occurred every 6 years.
